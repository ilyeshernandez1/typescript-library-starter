# `TypeScript Library Starter`

If you want to quickly build a TypeScript compatible library, you are in the right place.

This template repo will setup :

- TypeScript
- tsup (as a bundler)
- tsc (as a linter)
- changeset (as a version manager)
- The `package.json` correctly setup for types declerations.

> But, if you want to add more features, tools, simply fork it and change it like you want.
